- 👋 Hi, I’m @FelixOrion – Your friendly neighborhood **problem-solver** with a passion for crafting elegant digital experiences.
- 👀 I’m intensely interested in **architecting scalable and resilient software solutions**. My current obsession lies in the dynamic intersection of **low-code development (Salesforce, Outsystems, ServiceNow)**, robust **cloud infrastructures (Azure)**, and high-performance **backend systems (Java, Spring Boot, NestJS)**. I thrive on turning complex challenges into streamlined, efficient applications.

### **🚀 What I'm Currently Building/Learning:**

* **Deep-diving into Microservices:** Exploring advanced patterns and best practices for distributed systems to unlock unparalleled scalability.
* **Mastering Container Orchestration:** Becoming a Docker and Kubernetes whisperer to deploy and manage applications with seamless efficiency.
* **Honing API Design:** Obsessed with crafting intuitive, secure, and blazing-fast APIs that serve as the backbone of modern applications.

### **🛠️ My Toolkit:**

* **Languages:** Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, HTML, CSS
* **Frameworks/Libraries:** Spring Boot, NestJS, React, Express.js
* **Cloud Platforms:** Microsoft Azure (App Service, Azure SQL, Azure Functions, Azure Key Vault)
* **Low-Code Platforms:** Salesforce, Outsystems, ServiceNow (Foundational understanding & Eager to specialize)
* **Databases:** Azure SQL Database, PostgreSQL, MySQL
* **Tools/Concepts:** Docker, Git, CI/CD, OOP, RESTful APIs, System Design, Unit Testing, Integration Testing
